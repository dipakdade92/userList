1. SOLID Principles in Action
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
Each component should handle one responsibility. For instance, a UserList component will only display the user list, and a Pagination component will manage pagination logic.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Design components and functions to be extendable without modification. For example, encapsulate API logic in a service layer that can easily switch to another data source.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Design components to be interchangeable. A UserCard component could replace a UserDetails component without breaking existing functionality.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Avoid bloated components. Separate responsibilities like fetching, rendering, and pagination into distinct parts.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
Depend on abstractions. Use hooks and services for fetching data, decoupling React components from implementation details.

2. Advanced Design Patterns
Container-Presenter Pattern:
Split logic and presentation by using containers for fetching data and presenters for rendering it.

Higher-Order Components (HOCs):
Use HOCs to abstract common logic, such as retrying API calls.

Compound Components:
Utilize the Radix UI library effectively by creating compound components for reusable, flexible UI.

Error Boundary Component:
Implement a reusable error boundary for catching and displaying errors.

3. Code Structure
Organize files with a scalable directory structure:

css
Copy code
src/
├── components/
│   ├── UserTable/
│   ├── Pagination/
│   ├── ErrorBoundary/
├── pages/
│   ├── UserListPage/
│   ├── UserDetailsPage/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useFetchUsers.js
│   ├── usePagination.js
├── services/
│   ├── apiService.js
├── utils/
│   ├── errorHandlers.js
│   ├── constants.js

yes write highly optimized code also and make awesome UI , you can use tailwind or Radix or both , but it should be very attractive UI , keep in min otheriws e i will  send you in hell

Got it! I'll deliver highly optimized, professional-level code with an exceptional UI using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. The implementation will focus on advanced coding practices, clean architecture, and attractive design.

Here's the plan:

Features:

A paginated user list.
A detailed user page.
Retry logic for API errors.
Error handling with user-friendly feedback.
Unit tests for critical components.
Tech Stack:

React for the UI.
Radix UI for accessible and flexible components.
Tailwind CSS for styling.
React Router for navigation.
React Query for state and data fetching.
Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests.
Folder Structure:

Modular and scalable.
Let me start creating the code.

Edited
The foundational components and pages have been added with advanced optimizations and clean architecture.

Next steps:

Build the UserDetailsPage with Radix UI components for detailed styling.
Add a Tailwind-based theme for an attractive design.
Integrate unit tests for robust testing coverage.
Would you like me to continue with these, or refine the existing components further?

Here’s the list of external libraries that will be installed for this project, along with their purpose:

1. Core Libraries
react & react-dom: Core libraries for building the React application.
react-router-dom: For routing between pages.
2. State Management and Data Fetching
react-query: For efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.
3. Styling
tailwindcss: For a utility-first CSS framework to create a highly customized and attractive UI.
@radix-ui/react-primitive: For accessible, composable UI components.
4. Testing
jest: For unit testing.
@testing-library/react: For testing React components with user-focused assertions.
5. Build Tools
vite: For blazing-fast builds and development (assuming Vite is used based on your preferences).
Installing All Dependencies
Run the following commands to install these libraries:

bash
Copy code
# Core libraries
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom

# State management and data fetching
npm install @tanstack/react-query

# Styling
